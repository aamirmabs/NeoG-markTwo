# NeoG Camp - markTwo

The NeoG Camp is an initiative taken up by Tanay Pratap to introduce young minds to learn skills that are in-demand in the software industry in structured manner with the end goal of successfully mentoring a handful of motivated individuals and enable them to break into the industry.

The camp takes a bootcamp style approach with weekly coding sessions live streamed on YouTube where core concepts are explained in a practical manner by building something. Participants are required to then build something that demonstrates their understanding of the concepts.
